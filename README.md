### To Do Logically Next:
- [ ] Add any custom error Events necessary and the error handling middleware to reduce the amount of code in routers. 
- [ ] Add in the User, Friend and Gift Models Needed for all database information
- [ ] Add user authentication middleware and also the user routes to POST ( /auth/users create new user && /auth/tokens log in) and PATCH (to change password /auth/users/me) and GET (get currently logged in user /auth/users/me)
